Download, Install and Open the Kindle Perviewer. Open the .opf file with it and wait until the program does it's job.
(If it's taking unsually long or it's finished was too fast, there's a possiablity that you did something wrong.)
Upon completion, you're going to be able to view your work. Finish your project from File -> Export (Or ctrl+X) and export a .mobi file then sideload it to your Kindle.

Note: While trying to export, it is possiable to enconter an error stating: "Export might not be supported for certain books..".
Fear not. All you need to do is finding the temp folder location.
By navigating to View -> Conversion log (Or simply ctrl+G), an exel file will be opened which will probably contain the path.
It will look like this: "C:\Users\You\AppData\Local\Temp\0c832824-e260-240d-a72f-193940d98a44"
There you will find some intersting files, among them is your dictianory MOBI file. Treat it as an exported file and sideload it into your device.
