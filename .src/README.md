Follow the instructions inside the content.html and dict.opf files. (You can use Notepad++ for editing them.)
Read the Amazon's own "Publishing Guide for Creating Dictionaries" if you need more insight.

Download, Install and Open the Kindle Perviewer. Open the .opf file with it and wait until the program does it's job.
(If it's taking unsually long or it was finished too quickly, there's a possiablity that something has gone wrong.)
Upon completion, you're going to be able to view your work. Finish your project by exporting from File -> Export (Or ctrl+X) and export a .mobi file. Then, sideload it into your Kindle device.

Note: While trying to export, it is possiable to enconter an error and not be able to export your dictionary file.
Fear not. All you need to do is finding the temp folder name and location. It's a folder inside the path "C:\Users\You\AppData\Local\Temp\" directory.
You may find the folder's name by navigating to View -> Conversion log (Or simply ctrl+G), an exel file will be opened which will probably contain the path and the folder name.
The folder's name is something like: 0c832824-e260-240d-a72f-193940d98a44. Checkout the date and time of the files inside each folder if you're still unsure.
There you will find some intersting files, among them is your dictianory MOBI file. Treat it as an exported file and sideload it into your device.
