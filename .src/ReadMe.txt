Download, Install and Open the Kindle Perviewer. Open the .opf file and wait untill the program does it's job. (If it's taking unsually long or it's finished was too fast, there's a possiablity that you did something wrong.)
Upon completion, you're going to be able to view your work. From File -> Export (Or ctrl+X) export a .mobi file and sideload it to youe Kindle.
NoteT: While trying to export, it is possiable to enconter a warning or an error stating something like: "Export might not be supported for certain book..".
Fear not. All you need to do is finding the temp folder location. By navigating to View -> Conversion log (Or simply ctrl+G), an exel file will be opened which will probably contain the path.

There you will find some intersting files, plus your dictianory MOBI file. There you have it.
